<p style="font-size: 16px;">This is a simple Snake Game implemented using React. The game follows the classic rules, where the player controls a snake and tries to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body.</p>

<p><strong>Keyboard controls:</strong> The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.</p>

<p><strong>Score tracking:</strong> The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each apple eaten.</p>

<p><strong>Game over:</strong> When the snake collides with the walls or its own body, the game ends and the player can restart.</p>
